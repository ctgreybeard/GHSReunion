2 quotes or patterns had embedded tabs:
This means the display of this script could vary with device or software
  First at input line 37
   Last at input line 65

First indentation disagreement seen at input line 2
Ending with indentation disagreement which started at input line 2
Note: Indentation disagreement detection is not accurate for outdenting and -lp.

6 long lines were outdented:
  First at output line 41
   Last at output line 129
  use -noll to prevent outdenting, -l=n to increase line length

2 output lines exceeded 80 characters:
 First at line 16 by 139 characters
 Maximum at line 75 by 735 characters
 Last at line 75 by 735 characters
